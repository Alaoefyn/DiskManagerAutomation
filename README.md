# DiskManagerAutomation
A bash automation script that i created mainly saves time for disk repair and management that for people like to use terminal-based solutions.




1- Directly download the .sh file or create new one with ## touch disk_management.sh after creation, ## nano disk_management.sh and copy-paste the code inside.Remember,you need to be on the directory that where the code you create. For example, you created the file at Documents directory, but you are at the home directory as home@home- you should type the directory change command as ## cd Documents to be in the directory that the bash code you will work.

2- When the file is ready , type ## chmod +x disk_manager.sh on your terminal for give execute permission to script and after that ## ./disk_manager.sh to start.
